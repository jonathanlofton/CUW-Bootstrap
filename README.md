# Bootstrap Tool

This tool was created to understand how Treatment plant processing affects compounds that are found in Waste Water that is treated by a Treatment Plant. But the tool is just using an underylying bootstrap analysis that could be used for other data sets that have an In and Out value.

### Example Project Use:
  Seattle drinks a lot of coffee. Coffee has a lot of caffeine in it. If 50% of seattle has a cup of coffee in the morning thats a lot of caffeine that is going to Seattles Treatment plant. Treatment plants water ends up in a natural body of water. Does that mean that we are dumping highly caffeinated waste water into natural bodies of water everyday? Are Orcas addicted to caffeine?
  
  To test out your hypothesis you could find out the concentration of caffeine in waste water going into the Treatment Plant (Primary Effluent) and compare it to the concentration of caffeine in the waste water leaving the treatment plant (Final Effluent). And to make sure that your data is holistically representative you can use this tool to standardize the data set.



### Rules for Proper Use:

To use this tool correctly make sure to at least have a data set of at least 10 values for reproducable results.

### The test will output two lines:


###### The upper 95% CI around the median effluent concentration is _____.

###### The lower 95% CI around the median pollutant removal efficiency is _____.
